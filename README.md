My old Twitter bot, Auto "Otto" RNG. 

It tweets out a random number every hour or so, and tries to respond to requests for random numbers (sometimes it misses people, never quite figured out why). 

Runs on Google Script and is currently hosted via that as well. You can find Otto on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/autorng).
